# Data Science TA Hiring Assignment – Summary

This README provides a brief summary of the steps taken to complete each section of the Data Science TA Hiring Assignment.

---

## Section 1: Python + Machine Learning

- Loaded the student performance dataset.
- Cleaned column names and checked for missing values.
- Created average score and a `pass_fail` binary target.
- Conducted EDA using seaborn and matplotlib (score distributions, box plots, pass/fail analysis).
- Prepared data using one-hot encoding.
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier and evaluated with accuracy and F1-score.

---

## Section 2: SQL

- Used SQLite with the Chinook database.
- Wrote SQL queries to answer business questions (e.g., top customers, genre popularity, sales by country).
- Handled joins across multiple tables and used aggregation and sorting functions.
- Saved queries and outputs in a `.sql` file.

---

## Section 3: Tableau

- Used the `AB_NYC_2019.csv` dataset (Airbnb NYC).
- Built visualizations:
  - Listings count by neighbourhood group
  - Average price by room type
  - Availability trends by area
- Applied filters and created an interactive dashboard.
- Published the dashboard on Tableau Public.

---

## Section 4: Excel

- Cleaned the Online Retail dataset: removed nulls, duplicates, and negative quantities.
- Created calculated columns (`TotalSales`, `Month`).
- Built a Pivot Table to summarize sales by country and month.
- Calculated metrics: Average Order Value (AOV), % contribution of countries.
- Used conditional formatting to highlight top 5 countries.
- Created a line chart to show monthly revenue trend.

## Section 5: AI Tools & LLMs

- Used ChatGPT (GPT-4) for:
  - Clarifying task requirements and debugging
  - Guiding Excel formulas, Tableau visualizations, and SQL queries
  - Structuring Python code and ML workflows

---

## Section 6: Video Explanation (Optional)

- A short video walkthrough (2–3 mins) was recorded, explaining the assignment approach and tool usage.
